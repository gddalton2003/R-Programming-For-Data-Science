  Several R files are contained in this Projects folder that demonstrate a variety of skills that I used to write R code that include:
  General Statistics, Algorithms, Computer Programming, Computer Programming Tools, Data Analysis, Data Analysis Software, Data Management, 
  Data Structures, Problem Solving, Statistical Programming, and Data Wrangling.
  The outcome-of-care-measures.csv file is provided for the files related to hospital quality (rankhospital.R, best.R). The corr.R, complete.R,
  and pollutantmean.R files contain code for 3 functions that read data from a zip file containing 332 comma-separated-value (CSV) files containing 
  pollution monitoring data for fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution at 332 locations in the United States. Each file contains data from a single 
  monitor and the ID number for each monitor is contained in the file name. The function 'pollutantmean' calculates the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or
  nitrate) across a specified list of monitors. The function 'complete.R' reads a directory full of files and reports the number of completely observed 
  cases in each data file. The function 'corr.R' takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation between 
  sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold.
